## About

Rimbo beer brewery is a business concept created for my MS1 project with Code Institute.

Rimbo beer brewery is a business dedicated to brewing the best craft beer in the north. Rimbo beer brewery offers both craft made beers and brewery tours  
Currently they do not offer sales directly from the website. 

Rimbo beer brewery would need to have a website to tell users a little bit about the business, show potential clients what services they offer and showcase some of their current or existing work. Rimbo beer brewery will need to have a contact form so that new and existing clients can reach them easily. Rimbo beer brewery is a small company with a small range of website needs. there is scope for the business to grow. As the business grows the website can be adapted to the growing business and additional features implemented.

## Features across all pages.

Navigation Bar

The navigation bar sits under the hero image. the bar when hovered shows a solid black underline.
The navigation links directs the user to the correct page of the website.
When the rimbo beer brewery text is pressed it takes the user to the main page.
On larger screens the navigation bar is horizontal and centered. on smaller screens it stacks verticaly in the center and has a black underline.

Responsiveness
The page is scaled up and down for different screen resolutions to help the content stay neat. This has been done using of media queries.

Accessibility
All images and navigations have an alt attributes. This is to make the site easier to use for people with visual impairments by allowing them to navigate the site easily. There is high contrast used throughout the design. Header elements have been used in sequence so that the site makes semantic sense to screen readers. Links are consistent when hovered over. I have also set the font to rem so that if someone has their font settings higher for visibility the font size will increase accordingly.

Footer

The footer consists of social media links and will open in a new tab.
and a copywrite of the author.

Meta data
I have included descriptions, author, and keywords into the head element to increase traffic to the website. I have also labelled each page differently so that if the user has multiple tabs open it is easy to recognise each tab.
